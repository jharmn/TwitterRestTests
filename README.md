TwitterRestTests
================

An example of using BDD (in this case SpecFlow) to run tests against RESTful resources.

UPDATE: As far as I know, this sample will no longer run successfully, as this version of Twitter's API was deprecated.

Built to support the ideas in a PragmaticAPI.com blog post: http://www.pragmaticapi.com/2013/01/12/bdd-atdd-for-your-agile-rest-api/
